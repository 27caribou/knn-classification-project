# KNN Classification Project

In this project, you are given a classified set of dataset from a company. They have hidden the feature column names but have given you the data and the target classes. We will try to use KNN to create a model that directly predicts a class for a new data point based off of the features.

An important step in this supervised machine learning algorithm is to choose an optimal value for K, since that will affect what class a new point is assigned to. We will be using the **Elbow Method** to help us with that.
